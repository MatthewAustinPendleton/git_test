Hello world! This is Matthew here! I am learning to program using
a popular code camp of sorts known as The Odin Project.
It was made by professionals in the field in order to help
up-and-coming programmers to get to a level of competency that
they can perhaps land a job as a junior developer with a set of
skills that won't embarrass them in an interview setting! Or at least,
this is what I hope.
